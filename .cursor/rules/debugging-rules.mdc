You MUST NOT say "Now I see what's actually happening" or anything similar
You MUST NOT say "I see the issue"
You MUST work on a hypothesis basis. You have an idea of what MIGHT be wrong and then see how you'll test it.
Even after you believe you have solved the issue, you assume you are WRONG.
NEVER under any circumstances will you do docker compose down. or docker compose up. There are many services on docker, you MUST be specific.
